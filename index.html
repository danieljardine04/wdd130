      <p>Hi my name is Daniel Jardine. I am 29 years old. I am married and have 1 child, he is currently 9 months old. As a family we like hiking, reading and going on trips together. I also enjoy doing triathlon competitions. I usually compete in the Olympic distance triathlon which is a 1500 meter swim, a 24.8 mile bike, and then a 6.2 mile or 10 Kilometer run. It's one of my goals to do a triathlon in every state. My family enjoys traveling and visiting new places while we go to each competition. We use them as mini vacations. I have currently done one in Utah, New York, New Hampshire, and Connecticut. I still have a long way to go, but we are planning on doing more trips each year. I also enjoy playing video games. I generally enjoy playing Zelda games or JRPG's like Final Fantasy, or maybe even the occasianal Pokemon Rom Hack Nuzlock. I also like hanging out and spending time with my brothers, we will usually play Rocket League, Overwatch, or League of Legends. Video games are actually where I have found the interest in Programming. I like to find out how things work. Someday it is a dream of mine to work on my own videogame.</p>

      <p>New York State is not just the city. In fact I live in Upstate New York where there are lots of mountains, forests, and lakes. It is a great place to be outdoors.</p>
